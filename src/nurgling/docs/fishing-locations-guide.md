# Fishing Location Saving & Search System

The **Fishing Location System** allows you to save your fishing spots, complete with detailed information about catch rates, moon phases, and the equipment you used. Never lose track of a good fishing hole again!

## Overview

This system helps you:
- Save fishing locations with all relevant details
- Track which fish are available at each location
- Record catch percentages, time of day, and moon phases
- Remember what fishing equipment you used
- Search and filter your saved locations
- Quickly navigate back to productive fishing spots

## Saving a Fishing Location

### Step 1: Go Fishing

Cast your line at any fishing location in the game. When you catch something, the "This is bait" window will appear showing available fish.

### Step 2: Click the Save Button

Next to each fish name in the fishing window, you'll see a small **"Save"** button.

**Add screenshot of Save button next to fish name in fishing window**

When you click **Save**, the system automatically records:
- **Fish type** (e.g., Smelt, Trout, Pike)
- **Catch percentage** (e.g., 13%, 95%) - the final percentage shown after the calculation
- **In-game time** when you saved it (e.g., 14:30)
- **Moon phase** at that moment (e.g., Full Moon, Waxing Crescent)
- **Your fishing equipment**:
  - Hook type
  - Line type
  - Bait or lure used
- **Map coordinates** of your exact position

### Step 3: Confirmation

After clicking Save, you'll see a confirmation message at the bottom of your screen:

```
Saved Smelt location (13%)
```

**Add screenshot of confirmation message**

The location is now saved to your computer and will persist across game sessions.

### Method 2: Direct Right-Click

## Tips and Best Practices

### Saving Locations
- **Save multiple fish at the same spot**: If a location has several fish types with good percentages, save each one separately
- **Save during different moon phases**: The same location might have different fish during different moon phases
- **Note the equipment**: The system automatically saves your current fishing setup, so you can remember what worked

### Equipment Tracking
The system records your exact fishing setup when you save a location:
- **Casting rods** are often used with lures for specific fish
- **Bushcraft poles** are used with bait for general fishing
- Different hooks, lines, and baits can affect your results
- Review saved equipment to recreate successful setups

### Moon Phase Importance
Many fish in Haven & Hearth are affected by moon phases:
- Save locations during different phases to build a complete database
- Use the moon phase filter to find fish available during the current moon
- Full Moon often affects certain fish behaviors

### Search Strategies

**Finding the best spots:**
- Set minimum percentage to 70% or higher
- Select "Any" for fish name
- See all your premium fishing locations

**Finding specific fish:**
- Select the fish name
- Set percentage to 0
- Choose "Any" moon phase
- See everywhere that fish appears

**Finding current opportunities:**
- Check the current moon phase (look at your calendar)
- Set the moon phase filter to match
- Find fish available right now

**Finding rare fish:**
- Filter by the rare fish name
- Sort through results to find best percentage
- Note the moon phase and equipment used

## Storage and Persistence

All fishing locations are saved to a file on your computer:
```
C:\Users\[YourName]\AppData\Roaming\Haven and Hearth\fish_locations.nurgling.json
```

This means:
- Your fishing locations persist across game sessions
- They're saved locally, not on the game server
- You can back up this file to preserve your fishing database
- If you reinstall the game, copy this file to keep your locations

## Icon Colors

- **Blue circles**: Saved fishing locations (on minimap and full map)
- The icon appears on both the minimap and the full map for easy visibility

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the Save button in the fishing window"
- Make sure you're looking at the "This is bait" window that appears when you catch something
- The Save button appears next to each fish name in the list
- If you don't see it, you may need to update your client

### "Clicking a search result says 'different area'"
- The saved location is in a different part of the world (different map segment)
- You'll need to travel to that area first, then use the search again
- The system can only pan to locations in your current map area

### "My saved locations disappeared"
- Check if the file still exists at the AppData location listed above
- The file might have been corrupted or deleted
- Consider backing up this file regularly

### "The percentage doesn't match what I remember"
- The system saves the FINAL percentage (the last one shown after all calculations)
- This is the result after base percentage Ã— multipliers
- This is the actual catch rate you experienced

## Advanced Usage

### Building a Fishing Database
Create a comprehensive fishing guide for your village:
1. Visit fishing spots around your village
2. Save all fish at each location during different moon phases
3. Note the best percentages for each fish
4. Share location coordinates with your villagers

### Seasonal Planning
Use the search system to plan your fishing activities:
- Check which fish are available during current moon
- Identify the best equipment for target fish
- Plan fishing trips to locations with multiple high-percentage fish

### Equipment Experimentation
Track which equipment combinations work best:
1. Try different rods, hooks, lines, and bait
2. Save locations with each combination
3. Compare percentages to find optimal setups
4. Review saved equipment details to replicate success
