enc.routes.create5=Travel to your destination. Your character will pause periodically to calculate route pointsвЂ”input is temporarily disabled until a **white dot** appears under your character.

enc.routes.create6=Press the **red dot** again to stop recording once you reach your destination.
enc.routes.first_complete=Your first route is now complete. Test it by clicking a route point in the **Route Info** panelвЂ”the character should navigate to the selected point.
