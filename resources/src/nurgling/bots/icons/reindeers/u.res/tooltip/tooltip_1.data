This bot manages reindeer herds for quality breeding. You need an area with 'reindeers' specialization for pasture and 'deadkritter' specialization for carcasses. The bot will milk reindeer, sort by quality, and cull low-quality animals based on configured settings. Configure desired number of adult reindeer using settings button in Cattle Roaster window.
