#String tooltip
Open a soil stockpile before starting. Bot monitors the pile and drops excess soil to the ground, always keeping 10 items in the stockpile. Runs until stopped or stockpile is closed. You can use this when leveling large plots. Place a stockpile of soil on the area you are leveling. With a second character pave 3x3 area near the stockpile, open the stockpile and activate the bot. Continue leveling ground with the first character. The second character will continually drop new soil for it to despawn.
