This bot manages sheep herds for quality breeding. You need an area with 'sheeps' specialization for pasture and 'deadkritter' specialization for carcasses. The bot will milk sheep, shear wool, sort by quality, and cull low-quality animals based on configured settings. Configure desired number of adult sheep using settings button in Cattle Roaster window.
