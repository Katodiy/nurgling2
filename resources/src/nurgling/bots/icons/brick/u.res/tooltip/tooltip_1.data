This bot makes bricks from clay using kilns. You need an area with 'kiln' specialization for kilns and an IN area for clay piles. The bot will fill kilns with clay, add branch fuel, light them, wait for burning to complete, and collect bricks. It will continue automatically until no more clay is available.
