Chop down trees using axe from your inventory, with uprooting stumps using shovel from your inventory. You can uproot stumps or cut down bushes at the same time, also ignoring growing trees. Auto-refilling waterskins from nearby container is also possible if you have water in a barrel (or cistern) in an area that has 'water' spec. You can also eat food from inventory when hunger is low enough.
