This bot roasts wrapped food items (Fishwrap, Fruitroast, Mushroom Burst Glutton, Nutjerky, Stuffed Bird) using kilns. You need an area with 'kiln' specialization for kilns and an IN area for wrapped food items. The bot will fill kilns, add branch fuel, light them, wait for roasting to complete, and collect roasted items.
