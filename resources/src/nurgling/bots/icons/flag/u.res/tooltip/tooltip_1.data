This bot assists with land surveying by automatically digging or filling survey sites. The bot will find a survey object, open its interface, and repeatedly click 'Dig' button to perform terrain leveling. When survey site is complete or needs removal, it will remove the flag and move to the next one. The bot automatically restores stamina and energy when needed.
