This bot is designed to create, move, and slice cheese from racks based on orders defined in Cheese Orders. To use it, first create one or more orders in Nurgling Settings → Bots → Cheese Orders. You will need TAKE areas for each curd type, a PUT/TAKE area for empty trays, a PUT area for sliced cheese outputs, and cheese rack areas for each location (outside, inside, mine, cellar), each with buffer cupboards or chests. The bot will collect ready cheese into buffers, slice cheese from buffers, move cheese between areas according to your orders, and finally create new trays if space, empty trays, curds, and orders allow. Global PF is supported.
