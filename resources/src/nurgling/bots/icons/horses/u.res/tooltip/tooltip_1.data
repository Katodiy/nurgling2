This bot manages horse herds for quality breeding. You need an area with 'horses' specialization for pasture and 'deadkritter' specialization for carcasses. The bot will sort horses by quality and cull low-quality animals based on configured settings. Configure desired number of adult horses using settings button in Cattle Roaster window.
