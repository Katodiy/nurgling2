This bot boils lye from ashes using cauldrons. You need an area with 'boiler' specialization for cauldrons and 'water' specialization for water source. You also need an IN area for 'Ashes'. The bot will fill cauldrons with ashes and water, add branch fuel, light them, wait for boiling to complete, and collect lye. It will continue automatically until no more ashes are available.
