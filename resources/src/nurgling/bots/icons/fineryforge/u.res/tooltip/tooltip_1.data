This bot processes cast iron bars into wrought iron using finery forges. You need areas with 'fforge' specialization for forges, 'fuel(coal)' specialization for coal, and 'anvil' specialization for anvil. You also need an IN area for 'Bar of Cast Iron'. The bot will fill forges, add coal fuel, light them, forge wrought iron on anvil, and drop dross automatically.
