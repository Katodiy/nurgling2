This bot tames wild animals (horses, cattle, boars, goats, sheep, reindeer). The bot will find the nearest animal waiting to be tamed, attack it, allow it to escape repeatedly until tamed. If 'Rope after taming' setting is enabled in Nurgling Settings, the bot will automatically put a rope on the tamed animal. The bot handles combat automatically and gives peace to allow escape.
