This bot automates the pickling process for vegetables, eggs, and fish. It handles filling jars with fresh items, adding brine when needed, and extracting finished pickled goods. You will need areas with 'picklingJars' specialization and sub-specializations for each item type (Beetroots, Carrots, Eggs, Herring, Olives, Cucumbers, Red Onion, Yellow Onion). You also need barrel areas with 'Pickling Brine' specialization for brine refilling. You also need an area with ready products in PUT section. The bot works in three phases: filling empty jars with fresh vegetables, refilling brine on filled jars, and extracting completed pickled items. Configure which items to process in Nurgling Settings → Bots → Pickling Settings. The bot will only process enabled items that have corresponding areas defined. Global PF is supported.
