#String tooltip
This bot burns blocks or boards into ash using kilns. You need an area with 'kiln' specialization for kilns and 'blockforash' specialization for input piles with blocks or boards. The bot will fill kilns, add branch fuel, light them, wait for burning to complete, and collect ash. It will continue automatically until no more blocks/boards are available.
