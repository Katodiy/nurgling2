This bot manages pig herds for quality breeding. You need an area with 'pigs' specialization for pen and 'deadkritter' specialization for carcasses. The bot will sort pigs by quality and cull low-quality animals based on configured settings. Configure desired number of adult pigs using settings button in Cattle Roaster window.
