This bot is designed to unload mulch from compost bins. To use it, youâ€™ll need an area with the Compost Bin specialization defined, a PUT area for mulch, and optionally, an area for swill. The bot will attempt to refill the compost bins from the designated swill area. To enable refilling, go to the farming settings and activate the 'Fill compost bins with swill' option.
